<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This project is intended to provide a simplified and better-implemented approach for exporting Snapchat memories compared to the system provided by Snapchat and their Javascript implementation.

When using MemorEasy, you can rapidly download your Memories from Snapchat's cloud to your computer, while also tagging them with their relevant metadata in the EXIF section. Snapchat does not provide imbedded metadata
in the images from their servers, which is what makes importing with MemorEasy so important.

Likewise, the script also saves filenames in an organized format of `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.ext` inside of a child directory named `./memories/` in the parent directory where the script is executed. No more dealing with
the naming conventions Snapchat employs with randomized SID values.

Lastly, the script combines PNG layers back with their parent JPG/MP4 files to reflect how your Memories look inside of Snapchat itself. MemorEasy also saves a master JPG/MP4 file with no layers to preserve the original photo.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Downloading Snapchat's export ZIP files

Snapchat no longer includes per-Memory download API URLs in
`memories_history.html`. MemorEasy therefore cannot recreate those removed
links. It can, however, download the temporary ZIP links supplied by Snapchat
when your account export is ready.

Copy each ZIP link into a private text file, one link per line, then run:

```sh
python3 script.py download --url-file export_urls.txt
```

The archives are saved to `./snapchat-exports/` using stable names. Partial
downloads are resumed when the server supports HTTP ranges, completed archives
are reused, transient failures are retried, and every response is validated as
a ZIP file. Signed export URLs are intentionally never printed. You can also
provide links directly with repeated `--url` options, although a private URL
file is safer because shell history may retain command-line arguments.

Do not commit or share `export_urls.txt`; Snapchat export links may grant access
to personal data and may expire.


### Prerequisites

<!--This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
-->

1. [Download your Memories data from Snapchat.](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012305371156-How-do-I-download-my-data-from-Snapchat)
    - When asked which data you would like, only selecting the "Memories" option is required for this project, but you may select more data if you wish.
      **NOTE:** This will not export your My Eyes Only folder. This must be done manually in the app.
    - Ensure that the date range you want selected is correct. We recommend toggling date selection off to query all Memories on your account if this is
      your first time exporting Memories and/or running this script.
    - Next, you will be sent an email with a download link to a list of ZIP files (number of ZIPs depends on how many files you have). Download all of these files to the same location.
    - Extract the first folder (the one with no number), this contains the oldest set of memories along with the necessary `memories_history.html` file.
    - Now, extract the following ZIP files to the folder that was created when you extracted the first folder. This should put all of your downloaded memories
      in one large file labeled "memories". You know you are doing this correctly if you are prompted about a duplicate file `memories.html`. You can just skip or overwrite, it doesn't matter.
      ensure, however, that once all ZIPs have been extracted, you delete these HTML files and contain only JPG, MP4, or PNG files in the `memories` directory.
    - Find the other folder labeled "html" and copy the file up a level so that the HTML file and the `memories` directory are both in the same parent directory.
    - Steps in video format can be found in [this video](https://youtu.be/ioA1UjJznxI). If you have any problems setting up, please open an issue.
<!--2. Confirm that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your system.-->

### Quick Start (Recommended)
... Especially for Windows users

1. Download the pre-built executable for your platform from the latest release
   - [Windows](https://github.com/bransoned/MemorEasy/releases/latest/download/MemorEasy-Windows-X64.exe)
   - [Linux](https://github.com/bransoned/MemorEasy/releases/latest/download/MemorEasy-Linux-X64)
   - [macOS](https://github.com/bransoned/MemorEasy/releases/latest/download/MemorEasy-macOS-ARM64) (ARM)
   - [macOS](https://github.com/bransoned/MemorEasy/releases/latest/download/MemorEasy-macOS-X64) (X64)
2. **NOTE:** For MacOS and Linux, you __must__ install the required exiftool dependency:
   - MacOS: `brew install exiftool`
   - Linux: `apt install exiftool`
3. Move the downloaded executable/binary to the folder or directory where you want the images to be downloaded
   - Windows Example: Move `MemorEasy.exe` to `C:\Users\username\Pictures\`
   - Linux/macOS Example: Move `MemorEasy-Linux` or `MemorEasy-macOS` to `~/Pictures/`
4. Place the `memories_history.html` file and the `memories` directory from Step 1 in the same folder or directory as the executable/binary file
5. Continue down this page for instructions on running the program.

### Installation from Source (Advanced)

1. Clone and enter the repo where you would like the Memories to be imported
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bransoned/MemorEasy.git
   cd MemorEasy
   ```
2. Create and source a virtual environment (skip this step if you already have a virtual environment you would like to use)
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the required libraries
    ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies
   - Windows: Download [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/exiftool-13.43_64.zip)
     and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip)
     executables and add them to your PATH to be found by the OS/Python 
   - Linux:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg exiftool
     ```
   - macOS:
     ```sh
     brew install ffmpeg exiftool
     ```
5. Copy your `memories_history.html` file into the top level of the project directory
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Running MemorEasy

1. For Quickstart:
    - Run the script by double clicking the file if in a graphical interface or if in terminal by running `./MemorEasy.exe` or `./MemorEasy-OS_Name`
    - A shell or terminal window should appear and show current progress of downloads
    - MemorEasy will generate a `memories/` folder that will contain all of the organized JPGs, MP4s, and folders with your images


2. For Installation from Source:
    - Once the required libraries, dependencies, and user-specific `memories_history.html` file are installed and copied into the directory, you can run the script
      ```sh
      python3 script.py
      ```
    - The script should output the progress of the downloads and will generate a `./memories/` directory that will contain all of the organized JPGs, MP4s, and folders with your images
3. **NOTE:** If exporting many memories, this may take some time. Go get a coffee :\)
